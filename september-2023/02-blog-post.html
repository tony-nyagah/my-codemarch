    <h1>The Wonders of Nature</h1>
    <h2>Exploring the Beauty of Our Planet</h2>
    <p><strong>Earth</strong> is home to a myriad of <i>amazing</i> natural wonders, 
        from vast oceans and towering mountains to dense forests and arid deserts. 
        In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at some of the most <u>incredible</u> 
        natural phenomena our planet has to offer.

    <h3>The Great Barrier Reef</h3>
    <p>Located off the coast of <strong>Queensland, Australia</strong>, the <i>Great Barrier Reef</i>
       is the largest coral reed system in the world. It stretches over 2300 kilometers and is home to
       a diverse array of marine life, including more than 1500 species of fish, 411 types of hard coral, and 
       30 species of whales and dolphins.

       <blockquote>
        The Great Barrier Reed is a site of remarkable variety and beauty on the north-east coast of Australia. 
        It contains the world's larges collection of coral reefs, 1500 species of fish and 4000 types of mollusk.

    <h3>The Amazon Rainforest</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Amazon Rainforest</strong> is the world's largest tropical rainforest covering an area of approximately 6.7 million square kilometers
       in South America. In fact, it is estimated that <s>one-third</s> <ins>one-fifth</ins> of all known species 
       on our planet can be found in the Amazon.
    </p>
    <p>One fascinating fact about the Amazon Rainforest is that it produces 20% of the world's oxygen and plays a crucial role in 
       regulating Earth's climate. However, it is also under threat from <sub>deforestation</sub> and climate change, which could have devastating 
       consequences for the entire planet.

    <h3>Mount Everest</h3>
    <p>Standing at an impressive 8848.86 meters above sea level, <strong>Mount Everest</strong> is the highest peak on Earth.</p>
    <p>Despite the many challenges and risks associated with climbing Mount Everest, it remains a popular destination for adventure seekers around the world.
       In fact, it is estimated over <sup>4000</sup> people have successfully reached the summit since Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first did so in 1953.
